These are the steps for making Spaghetti:

1. In a food processor, puree the tomatoes to a smooth creamy consistency. 

2. Add olive oil to a large pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the onions and saute until they are soft, and before it actually starts browning a bit, add the garlic. If you'd like to make the sauce spicier, add a pinch red pepper, optional.

3. Add the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper.

4. Simmer on a medium-low flame for about a half hour. Thrive for balance in the consistency of the sauce, it has to be fluid but it should not look overly wet. A few minutes before taking the sauce off the fire, add half the basil and season with salt and pepper.

5. To serve: Cook a nice al dente pasta, dress with red sauce and finish with some freshly grated Parmesan, a couple of leaves of basil and sprinkle with extra-virgin olive oil. 

Special Note:

If you like a more traditional feel, you can wait and break them up in the pan later with a wooden spoon. If you did not process the tomatoes, use a wooden spoon to break them into pieces while they cook.

Enjoy! :)
